# knapsack
I brought this idea from a MIT opencourseware video, the MIT 6.0002 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science; '1. Introduction and Opiotimization Problems'. 

In the video, Prof. John Guttag presents the idea of a knapsack to their students, giving them a logical view of how can algorithms work and how to use computational models to understand the idea. The link will be provided on the bottom of this README file. 

The idea is not EXACTLY represented on this code, there is more to be added, this would be a whole complex algorithms playing, applying the capacity, the value and everything that the item you'd pack would be. But I just wanted to do this simple thing for fun while Prof. Guttag was explaining it.
